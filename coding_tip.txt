EDA
PCA-variance
ON PCA K-mean - display Elbow graph - based on elbow graph devide data into cluster - scatter plot
KNN Ppaer - Load data, process data, do KNN without
one columns with 0 and 1 as response variable - oter column as features
then tell about accuracy

K=Root N
K = 66 as per advise


4 column

one model on KNN vsualize accuracy vs K-value graph

now do PCA KNN on it

now do PCA K-mean and will devide the cluster , do KNN on the cluster
